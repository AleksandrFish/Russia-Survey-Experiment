# Russia-Survey-Experiment

Does criticism coming from foreign countries cause people to update their beliefs in ways that undermine autocratic leaders or does it tend to backfire, producing the opposite of the intended effect? 

I identify the causal effect of foreign criticism using a novel survey experiment in Russia. I subject subgroups of Russian citizens to social media posts from a fictional news agency on the topic of corruption. I vary whether the source of the information is domestic or foreign and whether participants receive one-sided or balanced criticism. 

I find that foreign criticism can lower evaluations of the Russian president, but only if that criticism is balanced (i.e. also presents criticism of the United States). Paradoxically, the most `persuadable' populations are the least likely to challenge the regime. I argue that  foreign messages are most effective in changing views when aimed at specific groups of persuadables who are nominally apolitical.
